# Hierarchical Visualization for Program Comprehension

## Introduction
A demo project is presented here to visualize the phases within the program's execution. Those phases are found by analyzing execution traces, that are collected through the instrumenter Blinky[1], and processed by Sage[2].

## SageVis

The code for the library to present the visualization can be found [here](https://github.com/kajdreef/sagevis).
